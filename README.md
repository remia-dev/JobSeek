# JobSeek

## Description

JobSeek is a comprehensive landing page designed to help job seekers in their quest for their dream career. With its user-friendly interface and intuitive design, JobSeek provides job seekers with easy access to a variety of job opportunities in different industries.

The website features a powerful job search engine that allows job seekers to search for jobs based on their preferred location, industry, and job title. Job seekers can also filter their search results to narrow down their options and find the best job for their skills and experience.

Website was made using Typescript + React + TailwindCSS for practice. This is also the first project I've used TailwindCSS.
